# LoRa LoStik Pipe & Networking Tools

So you have a fantastic long-range LoRa device, such as a Lostik, and
you'd like to be able to do Unixy things with it -- maybe pipe stuff
across the radio, maybe run a network over it.  That's what this is
for.



This requires a [LoStik](https://ronoth.com/lostik) or other Microchip
RN2093-based device that has been updated to firmware 1.0.5.  Details
below.


# Firwmare

See the documents tab for the
[RN2093](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/RN2903) and the
[firmware upgrade
guide](https://www.pocketmagic.net/rn2483-rn2903-firmware-upgrade-guide/) -
note that the upgrade part is really finicky and you need the "offset" file.
