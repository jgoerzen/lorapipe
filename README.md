# LoRa LoStik Pipe & Networking Tools

So you have a fantastic long-range LoRa device, such as a Lostik, and
you'd like to be able to do Unixy things with it -- maybe pipe stuff
across the radio, maybe run a network over it.  That's what this is
for.

Please see the [comprehensive documentation](https://github.com/jgoerzen/lorapipe/blob/master/doc/lorapipe.1.md).

This requires a [LoStik](https://ronoth.com/lostik) or other Microchip
RN2903- or RN2483-based or  device that has been updated to firmware 1.0.5.  Details
in the documentation.

I wrote an
[introduction](https://changelog.complete.org/archives/10042-long-range-radios-a-perfect-match-for-unix-protocols-from-the-70s)
and a [follow-up about
TCP/IP](https://changelog.complete.org/archives/10048-tcp-ip-over-lora-radios)
on my blog.
